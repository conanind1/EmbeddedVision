PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net system/bd_embVision_i/img_buffer_0/U0/img_buffer_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/synth.img_buff_synth/DOUTB_RED_O_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin system/bd_embVision_i/img_buffer_0/U0/img_buffer_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/synth.img_buff_synth/DOUTB_RED_O_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell system/bd_embVision_i/img_buffer_0/U0/img_buffer_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/synth.img_buff_synth/DOUTB_RED_O_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
